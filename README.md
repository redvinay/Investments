# Investments
Planning and Risk taking skills are Vital for an Investor!

My key principles to Invest Money:
1. Goal - It is very important becasue you should know your destination. Without your destination, you don't know where you are heading to
2. Knowledge - To gain knowledge, invest some time daily on reading financial articles and watching movies
3. Motivation - Never loose motivation or distract yourself from your Goal. Watch motivational videos daily for 10 minutes to make your self motivated and to keep your burning desire live
4. Planning - Plan your investments in a multiple portfolios to reduce your risk
5. Discipline - It is a key for any success. Do what you are doing consistently and regulary 
6. Patience - Have patience
7. Risk - Risk is a part of investments. Keep this in your mind and don't invest more than your risk appetite
